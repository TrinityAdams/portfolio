                <h3>My Journey into Web Development</h3>
                <p>Growing up right before the birth of the internet created a strong interest and passion in the way tech works. 
                    I have thus far been an observer, and am looking to get my foot in the door.
                    My first step into web development was in learning about copywriting and how to make webpages appealing and lucrative. 
                    I want to build my own website, mobile app, and API to continue practicing my skills as I join the industry.
                    The best way, in my mind, to do these things is to start from the ground up.</p>
                <p>I can only go up from here!</p>
